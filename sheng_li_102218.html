									Existing approaches on sequential modeling mostly serve as ‘black-box’ methods and are limited in their ability to interpret the results. Besides, these sophisticated learning models are known to be susceptible to deliberate adversarial attacks. While there exist several defense strategies against adversarial attacks on static data, these approaches do not take into account the structural property of sequential data. To close this gap, we develop a new learning framework based on adversarial training to improve the robustness to sequence classification. Specifically, it answers the question of When and How to perturb the data when applying the adversarial training. I will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in a diversity of real-world datasets, such as e-Commerce, natural language processing and remote sensing. In addition, I will briefly introduce my recent deep learning projects on action recognition and answer selection.
